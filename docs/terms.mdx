These Customer Terms and Conditions (this "**Agreement**"), effective as of the date on which you click a button or check a box (or something similar) acknowledging your acceptance of this Agreement (the "**Effective Date**"), is by and between Karrio, Inc., a Delaware corporation with offices located at 760 Chemin Marie - Le Ber, Verdun Quebec Canada ("**Karrio**") and the entity on whose behalf the individual accepting this Agreement accepts this Agreement ("**Customer**"). The individual accepting this Agreement hereby represents and warrants that it is duly authorized by the entity on whose behalf it accepts this Agreement to so accept this Agreement.

### 5. Suspension.

Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement, Karrio may temporarily suspend Customer's and any Authorized User's access to any portion or all of the Services if: (i) Karrio reasonably determines that (A) there is a threat or attack on any of the Karrio IP; (B) Customer's or any Authorized User's use of the Karrio IP disrupts or poses a security risk to the Karrio IP or to any other customer or vendor of Karrio; (C) Customer, or any Authorized User, is using the Karrio IP for fraudulent or illegal activities; (D) subject to applicable law, Customer has ceased to continue its business in the ordinary course, made an assignment for the benefit of creditors or similar disposition of its assets, or become the subject of any bankruptcy, reorganization, liquidation, dissolution, or similar proceeding; or (E) Karrio's provision of the Services to Customer or any Authorized User is prohibited by applicable law; (ii) any vendor of Karrio has suspended or terminated Karrio's access to or use of any Third-Party Products required to enable Customer to access the Services; or (iii) in accordance with Section 5.1 (any such suspension described in subclause (i), (ii), or (iii), a "**Service Suspension**"). Karrio shall use commercially reasonable efforts to provide written notice of any Service Suspension to Customer and to provide updates regarding resumption of access to the Services following any Service Suspension. Karrio shall use commercially reasonable efforts to resume providing access to the Services as soon as reasonably possible after the event giving rise to the Service Suspension is cured. Karrio will have no liability for any damage, liabilities, losses (including any loss of data or profits), or any other consequences that Customer or any Authorized User may incur as a result of a Service Suspension.

### 6. Aggregated Data.

Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement, Karrio may monitor Customer's use of the Services and collect and compile Aggregated Data. As between Karrio and Customer, all right, title, and interest in Aggregated Data, and all intellectual property rights therein, belong to and are retained solely by Karrio. Customer acknowledges that Karrio may compile Aggregated Data based on Customer Data input into the Services. Customer agrees that Karrio may (i) make Aggregated Data available to third parties including its other customers in compliance with applicable law, and (ii) use Aggregated Data to the extent and in the manner permitted under applicable law.

## 3. Customer Responsibilities.

### 1. General.

Customer is responsible and liable for all uses of the Services and Documentation resulting from access provided by Customer, directly or indirectly, whether such access or use is permitted by or in violation of this Agreement. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, Customer is responsible for all acts and omissions of Authorized Users, and any act or omission by an Authorized User that would constitute a breach of this Agreement if taken by Customer will be deemed a breach of this Agreement by Customer. Customer shall use reasonable efforts to make all Authorized Users aware of this Agreement's provisions as applicable to such Authorized User's use of the Services and shall cause Authorized Users to comply with such provisions.

### 2. Third-Party Products.

Karrio may from time to time make Third-Party Products available to Customer or Karrio may allow for certain Third-Party Products to be integrated with the Services to allow for the transmission of Customer Data from such Third-Party Products into the Services. For purposes of this Agreement, such Third-Party Products are subject to their own terms and conditions. If Customer does not agree to abide by the applicable terms for any such Third-Party Products, then Customer should not install or use such Third-Party Products. By authorizing Karrio to transmit Customer Data from Third-Party Products into the Services, Customer represents and warrants to Karrio that it has all right, power, and authority to provide such authorization.

### 3. Customer Control and Responsibility.

Customer has and will retain sole responsibility for: (i) all Customer Data, including its content and use; (ii) all information, instructions, and materials provided by or on behalf of Customer or any Authorized User in connection with the Services; (iii) Customer's information technology infrastructure, including computers, software, databases, electronic systems (including database management systems), and networks, whether operated directly by Customer or through the use of third-party services ("**Customer Systems**"); (iv) the security and use of Customer's and its Authorized Users' access credentials; and (v) all access to and use of the Services directly or indirectly by or through the Customer Systems or its or its Authorized Users' access credentials, with or without Customer's knowledge or consent, including all results obtained from, and all conclusions, decisions, and actions based on, such access or use.

## 4. Support.

During the Subscription Period, Karrio will use commercially reasonable efforts to provide Customer with basic customer support via Karrio's standard support channels during Karrio's normal business hours.

## 5. Fees and Taxes.

### 1. Fees.

Where paid for services are agreed between Karrio and Customer per the Order, Customer shall pay Karrio the fees ("**Fees**") identified in the Order without offset or deduction at the cadence identified in the Order (e.g., monthly or annually). Fees paid by Customer are non-refundable. If Customer fails to make any payment when due, and Customer has not notified Karrio in writing within ten (10) days of the payment becoming due and payable that the payment is subject to a good faith dispute, without limiting Karrio's other rights and remedies: (i) Karrio may charge interest on the undisputed past due amount at the rate of 1.5% per month, calculated daily and compounded monthly or, if lower, the highest rate permitted under applicable law; (ii) Customer shall reimburse Karrio for all reasonable costs incurred by Karrio in collecting any late payments or interest, including attorneys' fees, court costs, and collection agency fees; and (iii) if such failure continues for ten (10) days or more, Karrio may suspend Customer's and its Authorized Users' access to any portion or all of the Services until such amounts are paid in full.

### 2. Taxes.

All Fees and other amounts payable by Customer under this Agreement are exclusive of taxes and similar assessments. Customer is responsible for all sales, use, and excise taxes, and any other similar taxes, duties, and charges of any kind imposed by any federal, state, or local governmental or regulatory authority on any amounts payable by Customer hereunder, other than any taxes imposed on Karrio's income. To the extent that Karrio is required by law to pay any such taxes, duties, or other charges to any governmental or regulatory authority, Karrio may invoice Customer for such taxes, duties, or other charges and Customer will pay such invoiced amounts in accordance with this Agreement.

## 6. Confidential Information.

### 1. Definition.

From time to time during the Subscription Period, either Party may disclose or make available to the other Party information about its business affairs, products, confidential intellectual property, trade secrets, third-party confidential information, and other sensitive or proprietary information, whether orally or in written, electronic, or other form or media that: (i) is marked, designated or otherwise identified as "confidential" or something similar at the time of disclosure or within a reasonable period of time thereafter; or (ii) would be considered confidential by a reasonable person given the nature of the information or the circumstances of its disclosure (collectively, "**Confidential Information**"). Except for Personal Information, Confidential Information does not include information that, at the time of disclosure is: (a) in the public domain; (b) known to the receiving Party at the time of disclosure; (c) rightfully obtained by the receiving Party on a non-confidential basis from a third party; or (d) independently developed by the receiving Party without use of, reference to, or reliance upon the disclosing Party's Confidential Information.

### 2. Duty.

The receiving Party shall not disclose the disclosing Party's Confidential Information to any person or entity, except to the receiving Party's employees, contractors, and agents who have a need to know the Confidential Information for the receiving Party to exercise its rights or perform its obligations hereunder ("**Representatives**"). The receiving Party will be responsible for all the acts and omissions of its Representatives as they relate to Confidential Information hereunder. Notwithstanding the foregoing, each Party may disclose Confidential Information to the limited extent required (i) in order to comply with the order of a court or other governmental body, or as otherwise necessary to comply with applicable law, provided that the Party making the disclosure pursuant to the order shall first have given written notice to the other Party and made a reasonable effort to obtain a protective order; or (ii) to establish a Party's rights under this Agreement, including to make required court filings. Further, notwithstanding the foregoing, each Party may disclose the terms and existence of this Agreement to its actual or potential investors, debtholders, acquirers, or merger partners under customary confidentiality terms.

### 3. Return of Materials; Effects of Termination/Expiration.

On the expiration or termination of the Agreement, the receiving Party shall promptly return to the disclosing Party all copies, whether in written, electronic, or other form or media, of the disclosing Party's Confidential Information, or destroy all such copies and certify in writing to the disclosing Party that such Confidential Information has been destroyed. Each Party's obligations of non-use and non-disclosure with regard to Confidential Information are effective as of the Effective Date and will expire three (3) years from the date of termination or expiration of this Agreement; provided, however, with respect to any Confidential Information that constitutes a trade secret (as determined under applicable law), such obligations of non-disclosure will survive the termination or expiration of this Agreement for as long as such Confidential Information remains subject to trade secret protection under applicable law.

## 7. Personal Information.

Customer will ensure that its Customer Data, and its use of such Customer Data, complies with this Agreement and any applicable law. Customer is responsible for properly configuring and using the Services and taking its own steps to maintain appropriate security, protection, and backup of Customer Data. Customer may not store or process protected health information (as defined in HIPAA) using the Services unless Customer signs a Business Associate Agreement with Karrio. Customer may not store any payment cardholder information using the Services without Karrio's prior written approval.

## 8. Intellectual Property Ownership; Feedback.

### 1. Karrio IP.

Customer acknowledges that, as between Customer and Karrio, Karrio owns all right, title, and interest, including all intellectual property rights, in and to the Karrio IP and, with respect to Third-Party Products, the applicable third-party providers own all right, title, and interest, including all intellectual property rights, in and to the Third-Party Products.

### 2. Customer Data.

Karrio acknowledges that, as between Karrio and Customer, Customer owns all right, title, and interest, including all intellectual property rights, in and to the Customer Data. Customer hereby grants to Karrio a non-exclusive, royalty-free, worldwide license to reproduce, distribute, and otherwise use and display the Customer Data and perform all acts with respect to the Customer Data as may be necessary for Karrio to provide the Services to Customer, and a non-exclusive, perpetual, irrevocable, royalty-free, worldwide license to reproduce, distribute, modify, and otherwise use and display Customer Data incorporated within the Aggregated Data. Customer may export the Customer Data at any time through the features and functionalities made available via the Services.

### 3. Feedback.

If Customer or any of its employees or contractors sends or transmits any communications or materials to Karrio by mail, email, telephone, or otherwise, suggesting or recommending changes to the Karrio IP, including without limitation, new features or functionality relating thereto, or any comments, questions, suggestions, or the like ("**Feedback**"), Karrio is free to use such Feedback irrespective of any other obligation or limitation between the Parties governing such Feedback so long as Karrio does not identify Customer as the source of the Feedback without Customer's prior approval.

## 9. Warranty Disclaimer.

The Karrio IP is provided "as is" and Karrio
hereby disclaims all warranties, whether express, implied, statutory, or
otherwise. Karrio specifically disclaims all implied warranties of
merchantability, fitness for a particular purpose, title, and non-infringement,
and all warranties arising from course of dealing, usage, or trade practice. Karrio
makes no warranty of any kind that the Karrio IP, or any products or results
of the use thereof, will meet Customer’s or any other person’s requirements,
operate without interruption, achieve any intended result, be compatible or
work with any software, system or other services, or be secure, accurate,
complete, free of harmful code, or error free.

## 10. Indemnification.

### 1. Karrio Indemnification.

1. Karrio shall indemnify, defend, and hold harmless Customer from and against any and all losses, damages, liabilities, costs (including reasonable attorneys' fees) ("**Losses**") incurred by Customer resulting from any third-party claim, suit, action, or proceeding ("**Third-Party Claim**") that the Services, or any use of the Services in accordance with this Agreement, infringes or misappropriates such third party's US copyrights or trade secrets; provided that Customer promptly notifies Karrio in writing of the claim, cooperates with Karrio, and allows Karrio sole authority to control the defense and settlement of such claim.
2. If such a claim is made or appears possible, Customer agrees to permit Karrio, at Karrio's sole discretion: to (i) modify or replace the Services, or component or part thereof, to make it non-infringing; or (ii) obtain the right for Customer to continue use. If Karrio determines that neither alternative is reasonably commercially available, Karrio may terminate this Agreement, in its entirety or with respect to the affected component or part, effective immediately on written notice to Customer.
3. This Section 10.1 will not apply to the extent that the alleged infringement arises from: (i) use of the Services in combination with data, software, hardware, equipment, or technology not provided by Karrio or authorized by Karrio in writing; (ii) modifications to the Services not made by Karrio; (iii) Customer Data; or (iv) Third-Party Products.

### 2. Customer Indemnification.

Customer shall indemnify, hold harmless, and, at Karrio's option, defend Karrio from and against any Losses resulting from any Third-Party Claim that the Customer Data, or any use of the Customer Data in accordance with this Agreement, infringes or misappropriates such third party's US intellectual property or other rights and any Third-Party Claims based on Customer's or any Authorized User's (i) negligence or willful misconduct; (ii) use of the Services in a manner not authorized by this Agreement; or (iii) use of the Services in combination with data, software, hardware, equipment or technology not provided by Karrio or authorized by Karrio in writing; in each case provided that Customer may not settle any Third-Party Claim against Karrio unless Karrio consents to such settlement, and further provided that Karrio will have the right, at its option, to defend itself against any such Third-Party Claim or to participate in the defense thereof by counsel of its own choice.

### 3. Sole Remedy.

This section 10.3 sets forth Customer's sole remedies and Karrio's sole liability and obligation for any actual, threatened, or alleged claims that the services infringe, misappropriate, or otherwise violate any intellectual property rights of any third party.

event will either party be liable under or in connection with this agreement
under any legal or equitable theory, including breach of contract, tort
(including negligence), strict liability, and otherwise, for any: (1)
consequential, incidental, indirect, exemplary, special, enhanced, or punitive
damages; (2) increased costs, diminution in value or lost business, production,
revenues, or profits; (3) loss of goodwill or reputation; (4) use, inability to
use, loss, interruption, delay or recovery of any data, or breach of data or

event will either party’s aggregate liability arising out of or related to this
agreement under any legal or equitable theory, including breach of contract,
tort (including negligence), strict liability, and otherwise exceed the total
amounts paid and/or payable to Karrio under this agreement in the twelve (12)
months immediately preceding the claim; provided that, notwithstanding the
foregoing, Karrio's aggregate liability arising out of or relating to any
excluded liabilities will not exceed three times (3x) the total amounts paid
and/or payable to Karrio by Customer under this agreement in the twelve (12)
months immediately preceding the claim.

## 12. Subscription Period and Termination.

### 1. Subscription Period.

The initial term of this Agreement begins on the Effective Date and, unless terminated earlier pursuant to Section 12.2, will continue in effect for the period identified in the Order (the "**Initial Subscription Period**"). This Agreement will automatically renew for additional successive terms equal to the length of the Initial Subscription Period unless earlier terminated pursuant to this Agreement's express provisions or either Party gives the other Party written notice of non-renewal at least thirty (30) days prior to the expiration of the then-current term (each a "**Renewal Subscription Period**" and together with the Initial Subscription Period, the "**Subscription Period**").]

#### 2. Termination.

In addition to any other express termination right set forth in this Agreement:

1. Karrio may terminate this Agreement, effective on written notice to Customer, if Customer: (i) fails to pay any amount when due hereunder, and such failure continues more than ten (10) calendar days after Karrio's delivery of written notice thereof; or (ii) breaches any of its obligations under Section 2.3 or Section 6;
2. either Party may terminate this Agreement, effective on written notice to the other Party, if the other Party materially breaches this Agreement, and such breach: (i) is incapable of cure; or (ii) being capable of cure, remains uncured thirty (30) calendar days after the non-breaching Party provides the breaching Party with written notice of such breach; or
3. either Party may terminate this Agreement, effective immediately upon written notice to the other Party, if the other Party: (i) becomes insolvent or is generally unable to pay, or fails to pay, its debts as they become due; (ii) files or has filed against it, a petition for voluntary or involuntary bankruptcy or otherwise becomes subject, voluntarily or involuntarily, to any proceeding under any domestic or foreign bankruptcy or insolvency law; (iii) makes or seeks to make a general assignment for the benefit of its creditors; or (iv) applies for or has appointed a receiver, trustee, custodian, or similar agent appointed by order of any court of competent jurisdiction to take charge of or sell any material portion of its property or business.

No expiration or termination will affect Customer's obligation to pay all Fees that may have become due before such expiration or termination or entitle Customer to any refund.

### 4. Survival.

This Section 12.4 and Sections 1, 5, 6, 8, 9, 10, 11, and 13 survive any termination or expiration of this Agreement. No other provisions of this Agreement survive the expiration or earlier termination of this Agreement.

## 13. Miscellaneous.

### 1. Entire Agreement.

This Agreement, together with any other documents incorporated herein by reference, constitutes the sole and entire agreement of the Parties with respect to the subject matter of this Agreement and supersedes all prior and contemporaneous understandings, agreements, and representations and warranties, both written and oral, with respect to such subject matter. In the event of any inconsistency between the statements made in the body of this Agreement, the related Exhibits, and any other documents incorporated herein by reference, the following order of precedence governs: (i) first, this Agreement; and (ii) second, any other documents incorporated herein by reference.

### 2. Notices.

All notices, requests, consents, claims, demands, waivers, and other communications hereunder (each, a "**Notice**") must be in writing and addressed to the Parties at the addresses set forth on the first page of this Agreement or as identified on the Order Form (or to such other address that may be designated by the Party giving Notice from time to time in accordance with this Section). All Notices must be delivered by personal delivery, nationally recognized signed for on delivery courier (with all fees pre-paid), or email (with confirmation of transmission). All email Notices to Karrio must be sent to [legal@karrio.io](mailto:legal@karrio.io). Except as otherwise provided in this Agreement, a Notice is effective only: (i) upon receipt by the receiving Party; and (ii) if the Party giving the Notice has complied with the requirements of this Section.

### 3. Force Majeure.

In no event shall either Party be liable to the other Party, or be deemed to have breached this Agreement, for any failure or delay in performing its obligations under this Agreement (except for any obligations to make payments), if and to the extent such failure or delay is caused by any circumstances beyond such Party's reasonable control, including but not limited to acts of God, flood, fire, earthquake, explosion, war, terrorism, invasion, riot or other civil unrest, strikes, labor stoppages or slowdowns or other industrial disturbances, or passage of law or any action taken by a governmental or public authority, including imposing an embargo.

### 4. Amendment and Modification.

Karrio may change this Agreement (except for any Orders) from time to time at its discretion. The date on which the Agreement was last modified will be updated at the top of this Agreement. Karrio will provide Customer with reasonable notice prior to any amendments or modifications taking effect, either by emailing the email address associated with Customer's account on the Services or by another method reasonably designed to provide notice to Customer. If Customer accesses or uses the Services after the effective date of the revised Agreement, such access and use will constitute Customer's acceptance of the revised Agreement beginning at the next Renewal Subscription Period or, if Customer enters into a new Order with Karrio, as of the date of execution of such Order.

### 5. Waiver.

No failure or delay by either Party in exercising any right or remedy available to it in connection with this Agreement will constitute a waiver of such right or remedy. No waiver under this Agreement will be effective unless made in writing and signed by an authorized representative of the Party granting the waiver.

### 6. Severability.

If any provision of this Agreement is invalid, illegal, or unenforceable in any jurisdiction, such invalidity, illegality, or unenforceability will not affect any other term or provision of this Agreement or invalidate or render unenforceable such term or provision in any other jurisdiction. Upon such determination that any term or other provision is invalid, illegal, or unenforceable, the Parties shall negotiate in good faith to modify this Agreement so as to effect their original intent as closely as possible in a mutually acceptable manner in order that the transactions contemplated hereby be consummated as originally contemplated to the greatest extent possible.

### 7. Governing Law; Submission to Jurisdiction.

This Agreement is governed by and construed in accordance with the internal laws of the State of California without giving effect to any choice or conflict of law provision or rule that would require or permit the application of the laws of any jurisdiction other than those of the State of California. Any legal suit, action, or proceeding arising out of or related to this Agreement or the licenses granted hereunder must be instituted in the federal courts of the United States or the courts of the State of California in each case located in San Francisco County, California and each Party irrevocably submits to the exclusive jurisdiction of such courts in any such suit, action, or proceeding.

### 8. Assignment.

Customer may not assign any of its rights or delegate any of its obligations hereunder, in each case whether voluntarily, involuntarily, by operation of law or otherwise, without the prior written consent of Karrio. Any purported assignment or delegation in violation of this Section will be null and void. No assignment or delegation will relieve the assigning or delegating Party of any of its obligations hereunder. This Agreement is binding upon and inures to the benefit of the Parties and their respective permitted successors and assigns.

### 9. Export Regulation.

The Services utilize software and technology that may be subject to US export control laws, including the US Export Administration Act and its associated regulations. Customer shall not, directly or indirectly, export, re-export, or release the Services or the underlying software or technology to, or make the Services or the underlying software or technology accessible from, any jurisdiction or country to which export, re-export, or release is prohibited by law, rule, or regulation. Customer shall comply with all applicable federal laws, regulations, and rules, and complete all required undertakings (including obtaining any necessary export license or other governmental approval), prior to exporting, re-exporting, releasing, or otherwise making the Services or the underlying software or technology available outside the US.

### 10. US Government Rights.

Each of the Documentation and the software components that constitute the Services is a "commercial item" as that term is defined at 48 C.F.R. § 2.101, consisting of "commercial computer software" and "commercial computer software documentation" as such terms are used in 48 C.F.R. § 12.212. Accordingly, if Customer is an agency of the US Government or any contractor therefor, Customer only receives those rights with respect to the Services and Documentation as are granted to all other end users, in accordance with (a) 48 C.F.R. § 227.7201 through 48 C.F.R. § 227.7204, with respect to the Department of Defense and their contractors, or (b) 48 C.F.R. § 12.212, with respect to all other US Government users and their contractors.

### 11. Equitable Relief.

Each Party acknowledges and agrees that a breach or threatened breach by such Party of any of its obligations under Section 6 or, in the case of Customer, Section 2.3, would cause the other Party irreparable harm for which monetary damages would not be an adequate remedy and agrees that, in the event of such breach or threatened breach, the other Party will be entitled to equitable relief, including a restraining order, an injunction, specific performance and any other relief that may be available from any court, without any requirement to post a bond or other security, or to prove actual damages or that monetary damages are not an adequate remedy. Such remedies are not exclusive and are in addition to all other remedies that may be available at law, in equity or otherwise.

### 12. Publicity.

Karrio may identify Customer as a user of the Services and may use Customer's name, logo, and other trademarks in Karrio's customer list, press releases, blog posts, advertisements, and website (and all use thereof and goodwill arising therefrom shall inure to the sole and exclusive benefit of Customer). Otherwise, neither Party may use the name, logo, or other trademarks of the other Party for any purpose without the other Party's prior written approval.
