|      HTTP STATUS CODE SUMMARY |                                                                                                  |
| ----------------------------: | :----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
|                      200 - OK | Everything worked as expected.                                                                   |
|             400 - Bad Request | The request was unacceptable, often due to missing a required parameter.                         |
|            401 - Unauthorized | No valid API key provided.                                                                       |
|               403 - Forbidden | The API key doesn't have permissions to perform the request.                                     |
