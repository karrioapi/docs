## Custom Carrier

The question we are most asked is: **How to add a custom carrier?**

We have experimented and studied approximately ~100 shipping carriers API/web services to design the karrio structure as it is.

The good news is that making it easy to add a custom carrier fits perfectly with karrio' vision.

:::caution
To integrate a custom carrier at this stage, you will need:

- A minimal knowledge of Python
- Write code to extend the abstract classes
- Use the plugin/extension structure available
- Read and Understand the carrier' API documentation

:::

---

### Steps to integrate a custom carrier

1. Create a karrio extension package

2. Generate Python data types from the carrier API schemas

:::info
The package naming convention for extensions is `karrio.[carrier_name]`
:::

#### 1. Create a karrio extension package

Once you have [karrio installed for development](/development/setup) on your machine,
You can run the following command to scafold a karrio extension for you carrier.

```terminal
python run add-extension
```

```
Id: usps                                # Karrio unique carrier_name
Name: USPS                              # Carrier label that will be used throughout the app
Features [tracking, rating, shipping]:  # The carrier features you wish to integrate
Version [2023.1]:                       # The extension initial version
Is XML API? [y/n]:                      # Specify whether the carrier' API data format is XML. (n - for JSON APIs)
```

This command will create a karrio compatible extension folder under `sdk/extensions/[carrier_name]`
with all the boilerplate code required for your integration.
From there, all you have to do is implement the API data mapping from and to karrio unified interface and add API contract tests
to ensure that karrio generates the right requests for your API.
Additionally, you need to instruct karrio on how to parse responses returned from your carrier' API.

#### 2. Generate Python data types from the carrier API schemas

Karrio uses some cool open source projects to generate API schema datatypes.

:::info
We strongly believe in **types** because with a good IDE setup, they help you understand
the datatypes available and makes maintenance easy.
:::

- Generate Python datatypes for an XML/SOAP API

Karrio uses the `generateDS` project cli to turn XML files and XML schemas from SOAP webservices into Python classes.
Please check the [canadapost schema package](https://github.com/karrioapi/karrio/blob/main/schemas/canadapost/generate.sh) as an example.

> generateDS is installed along with karrio' dev dependencies. So it should already be available.

- Generate Python datatypes for a JSON API

Karrio uses a fork of `quicktype` to generate Python dataclasses from the `jstruct` library to turn JSON request and response
samples.
Please check the [amazon_mws schema scripting](https://github.com/karrioapi/karrio/blob/main/sdk/extensions/amazon_mws/generate.sh) as an example.

To use quicktype, you need to build a the custom docker image we have prepared for our fork.

```terminal
./bin/build-tool-image
```

### Extension anatomy

Considering the vision we aimed to achieve with karrio, the codebase has been modularized with a clear separation of
concerns to decouple the carrier integration from the interface abstraction. Additionally, each carrier
integration is done in an isolated self-contained Python package.

As a result, we have a very modular ecosystem where one can only select the carrier integrations of interest without
carrying the whole codebase.

**Most importantly, this flexibility allows the integration of additional carrier services under the karrio umbrella.**

:::info
karrio makes shipping API integration easy for a single carrier and in a multi-carrier scenario, the value
is exponential.
:::

#### Module convention

Two modules are required to create a karrio extension.

:::info `karrio.mappers.[carrier_name]`
This is where the karrio abstract classes are implemented. Also, the Metadata require to identified
the extension is also provided there.

> on runtime, karrio retrieves all mappers by going trought the `karrio.mappers` modules

:::

:::info `karrio.providers.[carrier_name]`
This is where the mapping between karrio Unified API data is mapped on the carrier data type corresponding requests
:::

#### extension signature

The Mapper is the cornerstone ofkarrio 's abstraction. A `Metadata` declared at `karrio.mappers.[carrier_name].__init__`
specifies the integration classes required to define a karrio compatible extension.

```text
from karrio.core.metadata import Metadata

from karrio.mappers.[carrier_name].mapper import Mapper
from karrio.mappers.[carrier_name].proxy import Proxy
from karrio.mappers.[carrier_name].settings import Settings
import karrio.providers.[carrier_name].units as units


METADATA = Metadata(
    id="[carrier_name]",  # e.g: "ddp_uk"
    label="[Carrier Name]",  # e.g: "DDP UK"

    # Integrations
    Mapper=Mapper,
    Proxy=Proxy,
    Settings=Settings,

    # Data Units (Optional...)
    options=units.OptionCode,  # Enum of Shipping options supported by the carrier
    package_presets=units.PackagePresets, # Enum of parcel presets/templates
    services=units.ServiceType,  # Enum of Shipping services supported by the carrier

    is_hub=False # True if the carrier is a hub like (EasyPost, Shippo, Postmen...)
)
```

#### file structure

The carrier extension package folder structure looks like this

```text
extensions/[carrier_name]/
├── karrio
│   ├── mappers
│   │   └── [carrier_name]
│   │       ├── __init__.py
│   │       ├── mapper.py
│   │       ├── proxy.py
│   │       └── settings.py
│   └── providers
│       └── [carrier_name]
│           ├── __init__.py
│           ├── address.py
│           ├── error.py
│           ├── pickup
│           │   ├── __init__.py
│           │   ├── cancel.py
│           │   ├── create.py
│           │   └── update.py
│           ├── rate.py
│           ├── shipment
│           │   ├── __init__.py
│           │   ├── cancel.py
│           │   └── create.py
│           ├── tracking.py
│           ├── units.py
│           └── utils.py
└── setup.py
```

:::info
Note that `pickup` and `shipment` modules are directories since there are often many sub to integrate such as
**create**, **cancel**...
:::

#### Mappers implementation

The mapper function implementations consists of instantiating carrier specific request data types assigning

:::info
The mapping function instantiates the carrier data types like a tree to allow a global view and simplify the
mental relation between the `code` and the formatted data output `schema`.

### Generated schema data types

To keep to robustness and simplify the maintenance of the codebase, In karrio, we use Python data types reflecting
the schemas of carriers we want to integrate.
That said, defining every schema object's structure can be tedious, long and unproductive. Therefore, code generators
are used to generate Python data types based of the schema format definition.

- For `XML` and `SOAP` services, [generateDs](https://pypi.org/project/generateDS/) is used to generate `.xsd` files
  into Python data types

:::info
Check the [generate.sh](https://github.com/karrio/karrio/blob/main/schemas/) file
to see how genereDs is used.
:::

- For `JSON` services, [quicktype](https://github.com/karrio/quicktype) is used to generate `.json` files
  into Python data types. We then use [jstruct](https://github.com/karrio/jstruct) as a replacement
  for python dataclass to add automated nested object instantiation.
