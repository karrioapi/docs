Docker is the easiest way to get started with self-hosted Karrio.

## Before you begin

You need the following installed in your system:
- [Docker](https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/) and docker-compose.


## Images

We release a new version of the server and dashboard every months.

```
# server image
karrio.docker.scarf.sh/karrio/server:[VERSION]

# dashboard image
karrio.docker.scarf.sh/karrio/dashboard:[VERSION]
```

The image is suitable for production use. See the [Configuration](#configuration)
for a list of environment variables you can use to configure the container.

You can find the available release version tags on dockerhub.
