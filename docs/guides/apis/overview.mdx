Whether you're building a custom branded shipping software or
looking for ways to extend karrio server, the following guide
will help you achieve your goals.

Karrio comes with a set of product that can be used to integrate shipping
capabilities to your apps. Developers can use the APIs to create a tailored
shipping experience for customers.

To that end, karrio exposes:

- REST - Interact with carrier services and create standardize shipping data.
- GraphQL - Manage your shipping data and customize your fulfilment process.


## REST API

The karrio shipping API is powered by REST. Rather than dealing
with non-standardized, often poorly documented carrier webservices
and arcane technologies such as SOAP. karrio proposes a unified
and intuitive REST API compatible with all supported carriers services.


### References

karrio exposes a set of REST API resources. The full references are accessible
at [`/openapi/`](https://api.karrio.io/openapi) with the description of all
APIs from your browser.

### Playground

You can download the karrio `OpenAPI` specification to quickly
familiarize yourself with the REST API and perform example requests
by importing it in tools such as [Insomnia](https://insomnia.rest/download)
or [Postman](https://www.postman.com/product/rest-client/)

## GraphQL API

karrio leverage a GraphQL API to expose access to shipping related
objects data available in the system. GraphQL is a query language that
allows clients to talk to an API server. Unlike REST, it gives the client
control over how much or how little data they want to request about each
object and allows relations within the object graph to be traversed easily.

To learn more about GraphQL language and its concepts, see the
official [GraphQL website](https://graphql.org/).

The API endpoint is available at [`/graphql/`](https://api.karrio.io/graphql)
and requires queries to be submitted using HTTP `POST` method and the `application/json`
content type.


### Playground

karrio exposes an interactive GraphQL editor under [`/graphql/`](https://api.karrio.io/graphql),
allowing access to the GraphQL API from your browser.

GraphQL Playground is an external interactive editor for your GraphQL queries.
It is based on Graphiql and accessible through the web browser.

Using Playground is easy and intuitive with its sidebar navigation contain
a listing of all operations available in the API. The Playground allows you
to quickly familiarize yourself with the GraphQL API, perform example
operations, and send your first queries.
