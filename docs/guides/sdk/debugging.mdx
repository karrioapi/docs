title: Error & Debugging
---


Karrio is designed to fail early whenever possible. Meaning that once you provide a valid input and
call the right interface, no exceptions are raised but all requests return a tuple of: `Tuple[ResponseType, List[Messages]]`.

Here, the `List[Messages]` will contain the **errors**, **notes** or **messages** raised during the process or returned
by the carrier web service.

## Examples

### Processing Error

```python
response = (
    [],
    [
        Message(
            carrier_name="canadapost",
            carrier_id="canadapost",
            message="Invalid request payload",
            code="KARRIO_FIELD_ERROR",
            details={
                "parcel[0].weight": {
                    "code": "required",
                    "message": "This field is required",
                }
            },
        )
    ],
)
```

### Carrier Error

```python
response = (
    [],
    [
        Message(
            carrier_name="canadapost",
            carrier_id="canadapost",
            message="You cannot mail on behalf of the requested customer.",
            code="AA004",
            details=None,
        )
    ],
)
```

## Debugging

Karrio uses [Python's built-in logging system](https://docs.python.org/3.8/howto/logging.html). So to visualize the
request workflow, set the log level of the default logger to `DEBUG`.

```python
import logging
logging.basicConfig(level=logging.DEBUG)
```

:::tip
  Setting the log level to `DEBUG` is very useful to understand how Karrio works and visualize
  the carrier raw requests generated as well as raw responses parsed during requests.
