## Custom Carrier

The question we are most asked is: **How to add a custom carrier?**

We have experimented and studied approximately ~25 shipping carriers API/web services to design the karrio structure as is.

The good news is that making adding a custom carrier easy fits perfectly in karrio vision.

:::caution
  To integrate a custom carrier at this stage, you will need:

  - A minimal knowledge of Python
  - Write code to extend the abstract classes
  - Use the plugin/extension structure available
  - Read and Understand the carrier API documentation
:::

---


### Steps to integrate a custom carrier

1. Generate Python data types from the carrier API schemas
  1. Generate Python data types from the carrier API schemas using the type generators bellow
  2. Package the generated data types as a library in [karrio-carriers](https://github.com/PurplShip/karrio-carriers)

1. Create a karrio extension package
  1. Create a new karrio extension by copying [.templates/carrier](https://github.com/PurplShip/karrio/tree/main/.templates/carrier)
      into [extensions/[carrier-name]](https://github.com/PurplShip/karrio/tree/main/extensions)

  2. Rename all instance for [carrier] to the appropriate carrier name you are integrating. This must be done for files
      and directories
  3. Uncomment all methods you intend to integrate  in `extensions/[carrier-name]/karrio/mappers/[carrier-name]/mapper.py`
      and `extensions/[carrier-name]/karrio/providers/[carrier-name]/__init__.py`
  4. Implement all enabled mapping functions across the module
  5. Uncomment all methods you intend to integrate `extensions/[carrier-name]/karrio/mappers/[carrier-name]/proxy`
      and implement the right HTTP calls


:::info
  The package naming convention for extensions is `karrio.[carrier_name]`
:::

### Extension anatomy

Considering the vision we aimed to achieve withkarrio , the codebase has been modularized with a clear separation of
concerns to decouple clearly the carrier integration from the integration abstraction. Additionally, each carrier
integration is done in an isolated self-contained package.

As a result, we have a very modular ecosystem where one can only select the carrier integrations of interest without
carrying the whole codebase.

**Most importantly, this flexibility allows the integration of additional carrier services under the karrio umbrella.**


:::info
  karrio makes shipping API integration easy for a single carrier and in a multi-carrier scenario, the benefit
  is exponential.
:::


#### Module convention

Two modules are required to create a karrio extension.

:::info `karrio.mappers.[carrier_name]`"
  This is where the karrio abstract classes are implemented. Also, the Metadata require to identified
  the extension is also provided there.

  > on runtime, karrio retrieves all mappers by going trought the `karrio.mappers` modules
:::

:::info `karrio.providers.[carrier_name]`"
  This is where the mapping between karrio Unified API data is mapped on the carrier data type corresponding requests
:::

#### extension signature

The Mapper is the cornerstone ofkarrio 's abstraction. A `Metadata` declared at `karrio.mappers.[carrier_name].__init__`
specifies the integration classes required to define a karrio compatible extension.

```text
from karrio.core.metadata import Metadata

from karrio.mappers.[carrier_name].mapper import Mapper
from karrio.mappers.[carrier_name].proxy import Proxy
from karrio.mappers.[carrier_name].settings import Settings
import karrio.providers.[carrier_name].units as units


METADATA = Metadata(
    id="[carrier_name]",
    label="[Carrier Name]",

    # Integrations
    Mapper=Mapper,
    Proxy=Proxy,
    Settings=Settings,

    # Data Units (Optional...)
    options=units.OptionCode,  # Enum of Shipping options supported by the carrier
    package_presets=units.PackagePresets, # Enum of parcel presets/templates
    services=units.ServiceType,  # Enum of Shipping services supported by the carrier
)
```


#### file structure

The carrier extension package folder structure looks like this

```text
extensions/carrier
├── karrio
│   ├── mappers
│   │   └── carrier
│   │       ├── __init__.py
│   │       ├── mapper.py
│   │       ├── proxy.py
│   │       └── settings.py
│   └── providers
│       └── carrier
│           ├── __init__.py
│           ├── address.py
│           ├── error.py
│           ├── pickup
│           │   ├── __init__.py
│           │   ├── cancel.py
│           │   ├── create.py
│           │   └── update.py
│           ├── rate.py
│           ├── shipment
│           │   ├── __init__.py
│           │   ├── cancel.py
│           │   └── create.py
│           ├── tracking.py
│           ├── units.py
│           └── utils.py
└── setup.py
```

:::info
  Note that `pickup` and `shipment` modules are directories since there are often many sub to integrate such as
  **create**, **cancel**...
:::

:::warning
  You don't need to create the file structure from scratch. start of by copying the template available
  at the root of the project under [.templates/carrier](https://github.com/PurplShip/karrio/tree/main/.templates/carrier)
:::

#### Mappers implementation

The mapper function implementations consists of instantiating carrier specific request data types assigning

:::info
  The mapping function instantiates the carrier data types like a tree to allow a global view and simplify the
  mental relation between the `code` and the formatted data output `schema`.
:::

### Generated schema data types

To keep to robustness and simplify the maintenance of the codebase, In karrio, we use Python data types reflecting
the schemas of carriers we want to integrate.
That said, defining every schema object's structure can be tedious, long and unproductive. Therefore, code generators
are used to generate Python data types based of the schema format definition.

- For `XML` and `SOAP` services, [generateDs](https://pypi.org/project/generateDS/) is used to generate `.xsd` files
into Python data types

:::info
  Check the [generate.sh](https://github.com/PurplShip/karrio-carriers/blob/main/py-canadapost/generate.sh) file
  to see how genereDs is used.
:::

- For `JSON` services, [quicktype](https://github.com/quicktype/quicktype) is used to generate `.json` files
into Python data types. We then use [jstruct](https://github.com/PurplShip/jstruct) as a replacement
for python dataclass to add automated nested object instantiation.


#### Data types libraries

We have a dedicated repo for all carriers generated data types. You can submit a PR there for a new carrier.
Check the [py-canadapost](https://github.com/PurplShip/karrio-carriers/tree/main/py-canadapost) package structure
to define yours.

:::info
  The package naming convention for carrier data types library is `carrier.[carrier_name]`
:::

---

### Advanced


#### Multi requests

Generally, the carrier web services expose one API endpoint to accomplish most operations describe supported by
the karrio unified interface. In some case, more than one API call are required to fulfil certain operation.

##### Abstraction

:::info Pipeline

  - The `Pipeline` instance is like an ordered dictionary where the keys are jobs identifier and the values are
  functions returning a `Job`.
  - The `Pipeline` exposes an `apply()` method that can be called to run sequentially the jobs provided following the
  definition order.

  > every job receives the response of the job runned before as first argument. This allow jobs to check the state
  > and determine if the current job should be executed or not.
  >
  > the first job receive `None`
:::

:::info Job

  - The `Job` is a flexible structure that accept by default an `id`, a `data` and optionally a `fallback` value
  > The `id` correspond to the job name used with a Pipeline
  >
  > The `data` is often a Serializable carrier request data.
  >
  > When a `data` is not provided, the `fallback` is returned without further action.
:::

##### Example

By example, the `FedEx` **Pickup** service doesn't expose a way to `Update` a pickup scheduled previously.
In such case updating a pickup is done by cancelling **the former** and **create a new one**.
That means two calls needs to be made to update a pickup.

- Implement the `pickup_update_request` mapping function using the Pipeline typeclass

```python
from functools import partial

# Import the the requests types from the carrier generated data types
from carrier_datatypes.pickup import CarrierPickupRequest, CarrierPickupCancelRequest

from karrio.core.settings import Settings
from karrio.core.models import PickupUpdateRequest
from karrio.core.utils import Pipeline, Job, Serializable

def pickup_update_request(payload: PickupUpdateRequest, settings: Settings) -> Serializable[Pipeline]:
    """
    Create a pickup request
    Steps
        1 - create a new pickup
        3 - cancel the old pickup
    """
    request: Pipeline = Pipeline(
        create_pickup=partial(_create_pickup, payload=payload, settings=settings),
        cancel_pickup=partial(_cancel_pickup_request, payload=payload, settings=settings),
    )
    return Serializable(request)

def _create_pickup(*args, payload, settings) -> Job:
    # create a carrier pickup request using the generated data types mapping with the PickupUpdateRequest payload
    pickup_request = Serializable(CarrierPickupRequest(...))

    return Job(id="create_pickup", data=pickup_request)

def _cancel_pickup_request(create_pickup_response: str, payload, settings) -> Job:
    # create a carrier pickup request using the generated data types mapping with the PickupUpdateRequest payload
    pickup_cancel_request = Serializable(CarrierPickupRequest(...))

    return Job(id="cancel_pickup", data=pickup_cancel_request, fallback="")
```

- Implement the `modify_pickup` proxy function by applying the pipeline

```python
from karrio.core.utils import Deserializable, Serializable, request as http, Job, Pipeline

def modify_pickup(self, request: Serializable[Pipeline]) -> Deserializable[str]:
    def process(job: Job):
        if job.data is None:
            return job.fallback

        return http(
            url=f"{self.settings.server_url}/pickup",
            data=bytearray(job.data.serialize(), "utf-8"),
            headers={"Content-Type": "application/xml"},
            method="POST",
        )

    pipeline: Pipeline = request.serialize()
    response = pipeline.apply(process)

    return Deserializable(response)
```


#### Code reuse

Remember that extensions are distributed as Python packages. Therefore, in order to reuse a carrier integration that
has many different services with a lot of shared functionality, it is recommended to package separately
the `karrio.provider.carrier` module that can be used as a dependency to many variation
of `karrio.mappers.carrier_service` modules in their own respective packages.

:::info
  By example, there are two `FedEx` related extension `karrio.fedex` and `karrio.fedex_express` because we can
  reuse most of the `karrio.fedex` package implementation in a `karrio.fedex_freight` extension later on.
:::

#### Helpers

After integrating and experimenting with multiple carriers services, some data structure manipulation lead to the
implementation of utilities functions located in `karrio.core.utils` module.
