This section is dedicated to the karrio core shipping SDK. This SDK is a formed
of a set of abtractions and implementations of the shipping services. The constructs
and helpers functions provided helps build a framework for shipping services integration.

This the translation pattern that maps various carrier APIs under a unified set of
data models.


The key features are:

- **Unified API**: A standardized set of models representing the common shipping data (`Address`, `Parcel`, `Shipment`...)
- **Intuitive API**: A library that abstracts and unifies the typical shipping API services (`Rating`, `Pickup`, `Tracking`...)
- **Multi-carrier**: Integrate Karrio once and connect to multiple shipping carrier APIs
- **Custom carrier**: A framework to integrate a shipping carrier services within minutes


## Usage

The Karrio SDK offer a modular set of packages. The karrio core package and a set of
supported carrier extensions.

You can therefore use the karrio SDK without any of the server API aspect of the project.

:::caution
The SDK is written in Python. Therefore, you can only use it within a Python project.

Using the karrio server APIs gives you a better interoperability with other languages
and ecosystems.

### Installation

- Fetch shipping rates

```python
import purplship
from purplship.core.models import Address, Parcel, RateRequest
from purplship.mappers.canadapost.settings import Settings


# Initialize a carrier gateway
canadapost = purplship.gateway["canadapost"].create(
    Settings(
        username="username",
        password="password",
        customer_number="123456789",
        test=True
    )
)

# Fetching shipment rates

# Provide the shipper's address
shipper = Address(
    postal_code="V6M2V9",
    city="Vancouver",
    country_code="CA",
    state_code="BC",
    address_line1="5840 Oak St"
)

# Provide the recipient's address
recipient = Address(
    postal_code="E1C4Z8",
    city="Moncton",
    country_code="CA",
    state_code="NB",
    residential=False,
    address_line1="125 Church St"
)

# Specify your package dimensions and weight
parcel = Parcel(
    height=3.0,
    length=6.0,
    width=3.0,
    weight=0.5,
    weight_unit='KG',
    dimension_unit='CM'
)

# Prepare a rate request
rate_request = RateRequest(
    shipper=shipper,
    recipient=recipient,
    parcels=[parcel],
)

# Send a rate request using a carrier gateway
response = purplship.Rating.fetch(rate_request).from_(canadapost)

# Parse the returned response
rates, messages = response.parse()

print(rates)
# [
#     RateDetails(
#         carrier_name="canadapost",
#         carrier_id="canadapost",
#         currency="CAD",
#         transit_days=2,
#         service="canadapost_xpresspost",
#         discount=1.38,
#         base_charge=12.26,
#         total_charge=13.64,
#         duties_and_taxes=0.0,
#         extra_charges=[
#             ChargeDetails(name="Automation discount", amount=-0.37, currency="CAD"),
