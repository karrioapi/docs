# Karrio GraphQL API

karrio leverage a GraphQL API to expose access to shipping related
objects data available in the system. GraphQL is a query language that
allows clients to talk to an API server. Unlike REST, it gives the client
control over how much or how little data they want to request about each
object and allows relations within the object graph to be traversed easily.

To learn more about GraphQL language and its concepts, see the
official [GraphQL website](https://graphql.org/).

The API endpoint is available at `/graphql/` and requires queries to be
submitted using HTTP `POST` method and the `application/json` content type.


## GraphQL Playground

karrio exposes an interactive GraphQL editor under `/graphql/`, allowing
access to the GraphQL API from your browser.

GraphQL Playground is an external interactive editor for your GraphQL queries.
It is based on Graphiql and accessible through the web browser.

Using Playground is easy and intuitive with its sidebar navigation contain
a listing of all operations available in the API. The Playground allows you
to quickly familiarize yourself with the GraphQL API, perform example
operations, and send your first queries.
