# Development quickstart

Get up and running with our client libraries and start developing your Purplship
integration.

Integrating Purplship into your app or website can begin as soon as you create
a Purplship account, and requires three steps:

`1` [Install a client library](#1-install-a-client-library) so your integration
can interact with the Purplship API

`2` [Obtain your API keys](#2-obtain-your-api-keys) so Purplship can authenticate
your integration’s API requests

`3` [Make a test API request](#3-make-a-test-api-request) to confirm everything
is up and running


---


## `1` Install a client library

We provide official libraries for different programming languages.

<div id="tabs">
<Tabs>
<TabItem value="node" label="Node">

```shell
# Install via npm
npm install --save purplship
```

</TabItem>
<TabItem value="python" label="Python">

```shell
# Install through pip
pip install --upgrade purplship-python
```

</TabItem>
<TabItem value="php" label="PHP">

```shell
# Install the PHP library via Composer
composer require purplship/purplship-php
```

</TabItem>
<TabItem value="js" label="Javascript">

```shell
# Add script to an HTML page
<script src="https://[api.purplship.com]/static/js/purplship.js"></script>
```

</TabItem>
</Tabs>
</div>


---


## `2` Obtain your API keys

Purplship authenticates your API requests using your account’s API keys.
If you don’t include your key when making an API request, or use one
that is incorrect or outdated, Purplship returns an error.

Purplship accounts support two type of keys: an `API key` ideal for server
applications and a `JSON Web Token` ideal for client applications.

You can generate new `JSON Web Token` by API requests providing an account
credentials (email, password). For convenience, your `API key` is
always available in the Dashboard

## `3` Make a test API request

To check that your integration is working correctly, make a test API request
using your `API key` to create an Address.

<div id="tabs">
<Tabs>
<TabItem value="node" label="Node">

```javascript
// Set your API key.
// See your keys here: https://cloud.purplship.com/developers/api
const purplship = require('purplship')('key_...');

const adddress = await purplship.addresses.create({
	"address_line1": "125 Church St",
	"person_name": "John Doe",
	"city": "Moncton",
	"country_code": "CA",
	"postal_code": "E1C4Z8",
	"state_code": "NB",
});
```

</TabItem>
<TabItem value="python" label="Python">

```python

# Set your secret key. Remember to switch to your live secret key in production.
# See your keys here: https://dashboard.stripe.com/apikeys
import purplship
purplship.api_key = 'key_...'

adddress = purplship.addresses.create({
	"address_line1": "125 Church St",
	"person_name": "John Doe",
	"city": "Moncton",
	"country_code": "CA",
	"postal_code": "E1C4Z8",
	"state_code": "NB",
});
```

</TabItem>
<TabItem value="php" label="PHP">

```php
// Set your API key.
// See your keys here: https://cloud.purplship.com/developers/api
$purplship = new \Purplship\Purplship('key_...');

$adddress = $purplship->addresses->create([
  "address_line1" => "125 Church St",
  "person_name" => "Johm Doe",
  "city" => "Moncton",
  "country_code" => "CA",
  "postal_code" => "E1C4Z8",
  "state_code" => "NB",
]);
```

</TabItem>
<TabItem value="js" label="Javascript">

```javascript
// Set your API key.
// See your keys here: https://cloud.purplship.com/developers/api
const purplship = Purplship('key_...');

(async () => {
  const adddress = await purplship.addresses.create({
    "address_line1": "125 Church St",
    "person_name": "John Doe",
    "city": "Moncton",
    "country_code": "CA",
    "postal_code": "E1C4Z8",
    "state_code": "NB",
  });
})();
```

</TabItem>
</Tabs>
</div>

Purplship returns an Address object in response to your API request.

```json
{
  "id": "adr_7686aff180044495a83610713d47c38a",
  "postal_code": "E1C4Z8",
  "city": "Moncton",
  "federal_tax_id": null,
  "state_tax_id": null,
  "person_name": "John Doe",
  "company_name": null,
  "country_code": "CA",
  "email": null,
  "phone_number": null,
  "state_code": "NB",
  "suburb": null,
  "residential": false,
  "address_line1": "125 Church St",
  "address_line2": null,
  "validate_location": false,
  "validation": null
}
```

## Next Steps

After you successfully make an API request, pick a guide to continue your integration.
