## Overview

There are two ways of processing shipments in Karrio:

- Direct label creation
- Order fulfillment

Karrio orders API is design a readonly API. Meaning that we consider your ERP, WMS or OMS as the source of truth for orders.
You can use Karrio to process shipments for orders that are already in your system. All you need is to leverage Karrio's API
to create orders based on your existing orders and use the webhook to get notified when the order fulfillment status changes.

Here's a short demo of how to create and fulfil an order in Karrio:


<div id="tailwind">

<VideoWrapper>
  <iframe
    width="560"
    height="315"
    src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/dFHZosJPaLI"
    title="YouTube video player"
    frameborder="0"
    allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share"
    allowfullscreen
  ></iframe>
</VideoWrapper>
