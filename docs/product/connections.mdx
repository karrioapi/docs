# Carrier Accounts

Once karrio is up and running, the first thing to do is to register your carrier accounts.
The carrier accounts you register will be used to process all other requests such as
shipping rates, shipping labels, and fetching of tracking statuses.

## Adding a carrier account

You can register your carrier account using the karrio Dashboard.

:::note To add a carrier account

1. Go to the `Carriers` section.
2. Click `Connect Carrier`.
3. Select your prefered carrier.
4. Fill in the account and API credentials.
5. Click `Submit`.

## Connection Mode

karrio' first goal is to make shipping services integration and automation easy.
Therefore, the `test mode` option here is suited for development and testing.
By checking it during your account registration, you are instructingkarrio
to connect to the carrier' sandbox server.

:::tip

The `test mode` is great to experiment and test that your carrier integration is
fully functional.

Generally carriers will ignore all label purchased or any scheduled pickups in
that mode. So you don't have to worry about any charges from carriers.

:::

:::info

Leave the `test mode` unchecked for carrier accounts to use in `live mode` (in production).

:::

From the karrio Dashboard, you can change the mode to visualize and operate
the API in `test mode` by enabling the `View test data` toggle.

## Preconfigured carrier accounts

Whe you sign up to [app.karrio.io](https://app.karrio.io) you will
have access to preconfigured carrier accounts. This is convenient because you
get to test and use a carrier services without having to register your own account.

:::caution

Note that when you deploy your own karrio instance, you will only have access
to your own registered carrier accounts.

:::

You can choose to opt-in to the preconfigured carrier accounts by enabling them
for your karrio user account.

:::note To enable a preconfigured carrier account

1. Go to the `Carriers` section.
2. Click `Karrio Accounts`.
3. Toggle on desired carrier connections.
