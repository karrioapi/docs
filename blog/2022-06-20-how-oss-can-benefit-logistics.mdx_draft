### 1. Absolute Transparency
  Open source transparency is begins with the accessibility of the source code.
  That transparency has the power to inciting trust and confidence from users.
  Furthermore, the code being public and available gives a sense of stability
  when it comes to the longevity of the project.

  In the quest for supply chain visibility, it could greatly benefit the logistics industry
  to have a clear understanding of how a piece of technology process and consume shipping
  data.

### 2. Flexibility
  Open-source software brings a lot of flexibility when it comes to extending the functionality
  or making changes to it. The benefit is that developers can easily adapt the software to their
  company's needs. They can make changes to problematic aspects of the app which is a great
  advantage.

  Integrating carrier services or leveraging existing carrier integrations becomes a lot easier
  since the open source software provide an open standard to the fragmented logistics industry
  and an easy way to eveluate carrier performance and services.

### 3. Agility
  Agility is a quality that makes a business more competitive. Open-source brings agility
  since it allows multiple ways to solve a single problem. Moreover, open-source software
  is continuously improved by members of its community.

  A single integration giving access to a network of carriers is a great way to make the
  logistics processes agile and more efficient.

### 4. Cost-efficiency
  Leveraging open-source software reduces the cost of in-house development and time to market.
  Open-source tend to build an ecosystem of tools that do not need to be reinvented by each.

  The fragmentation of the logistics industry and the lack of data exchange standards makes it
  costly and slow to fully integrate with a carrier. However, open-source can level the playing
  field and empower shippers of all size to stay up to the shipping standard established by
  indutry giants lik Amazon by partenering with DHL, FedEx, UPS and many logistics providers.

### 5. Starting out small
  The possibility to start small and test the open-source software on a smaller scale is not
  only cost-effective but has other benefits. For one, companies can see if the solution is
  truly the best one for them.

  Therefore, this open-source advantage makes it easier for companies to try out different
  solutions and later scale them if needed. You can experiment with various logistics processes
  and easily automate them at scale when you find the best suited solution.

### 7. Powering the digital transformation
  Industries are going through digital transformation and businesses that don't follow suit are
  left behind. **According to this research study, open-source is a critical driver of modern IT
  agendas.**

  Open-source software is deployed with the following objectices:
  - Reducing overall costs 57%,
  - Improving development team efficiency by 55%
  - Shifting IT infrastructure or workloads to the cloud 54%

### 8. The open-source community and talent attraction
  OSS can attract talent to a project but the ecosystem developed around it has
  the power to attract talent for the logistics space at large.
  Often heard entrepreneurs in the space telling us that devs find shipping boring.

### 9. No vendor lock-in
  An Open Source solution gives you the power to efficiently integrate technologically
  and maintaining relashionships with your shipping carriers


At Karrio, we are laying the foundations for a community of developers passionate on
solving logistics problems with modern technology and collaboration through open source.
