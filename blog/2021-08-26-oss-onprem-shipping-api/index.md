### The need for carrier integration

One of the critical determinants of Amazonâ€™s success is their access to a network of
logistics carriers combined with their investment in strategic warehouse establishment.
As your shipping volume and your product selection grow, a multi-carrier strategy
becomes a smarter choice. Integrating your platform to a network of carriers will
allow your shoppers to get the best experience and value for shipments with different
weights, dimensions and expected services.

### Developer experience and time-to-value

Developers often face two challenges when integrating with a shipping carrier Webservice.
First, the integration is tedious and long as most of the major carriers use arcane
technologies that do not blend easily with modern software development practices.
Added to that, documentations are either non-existent, long and complex and simply
not up to modern dev standards.
Secondly, there is a fragmentation and no ruling standard across the logistics industry
for data exchange. Meaning, web services do not share a unified data exchange protocol
but rather each company offers its own Interface. The consequence is that for any
integration needed, you will have to go through a new learning and discovery curve with
each carrier individually.

### Why is it still unsolved?

Most of the saas platforms offering shipping APIs are exclusively tailored to work with
their implementation which creates a vendor lockin and reliance on their servers.
Our first goal is to lower the barrier of entry for shipping carrier services integration.
To accomplish that, we have opted to adopt the open-core model for simple distribution
and additionally offer teams control over the roadmap with the freedom to develop additional
features without restriction.

### A modern toolbox

Karrio is more than a black box multi-carrier Saas API. It is a toolbox that proposes a
unified API to communicate with all supported carriers and an open-source abstraction that
serves as a framework for additional carrier integration.

Karrio is written in Python with a Django REST app layer and a React web app. Join the
community today and contribute to making shipping service integration accessible to
businesses of all sizes.
